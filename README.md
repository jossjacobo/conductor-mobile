Conductor Mobile
================

Conductor Mobile is a port of the [Conductor](https://github.com/conductor-framework/conductor) Web Framework for iOS and Android, instead of wrapping around [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) it wraps the [Appium Framework](http://appium.io/). Thanks to [@ddavison]

# Getting Started
Using maven, add jitpack.io to your repositories and include it as a dependency:
```xml
<repositories>
    
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
    
</repositories>

<dependencies>

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.willowtreeapps</groupId>
        <artifactId>conductor-mobile</artifactId>
        <version>v1.0</version>
    </dependency>
    
</dependencies>
```
Create a Java Class, and extend it from `com.joss.conductor.mobile.Locomotive`

# Goals
Same as the original conductor, the primary goals of this project are to...
- Take advantage of method chaining, to create a fluent interface.
- Abstract the programmer from bloated scripts resulting from using too many css selectors, and too much code.
- Provide a quick and easy framework in Selenium 2 using Java, to get started writing scripts.
- Provide a free to use framework for any starting enterprise, or individual programmer.
- Automatic detection of connected iOS devices

# Default Properties
- `deviceName` = {name of the device}
- `appPackageName` = {android app package name}
- `apk` = {path to apk}
- `ipa` = {path to ipa}
- `platformName` = {string: android or ios}
- `platformVersion` = {string: appium platform version}
- `udid` = {string: iOS device's UDID or Android's device name from ADB}
- `language` = {string: }
- `locale` = {string: }
- `orientation` = {string: portrait or landscape}
- `autoWebview` = {boolean: true or false}
- `noReset` = {boolean: true or false}
- `fullReset` = {boolean: true or false}
- `hub` = {string: url}
- `timeout` = {int: default equals 5 seconds per call}
- `retries` = {int: default equals 5 retries}
- `screenshotsOnFail` = {boolean: true or false}
- `autoGrantPermissions` = {boolean: true or false}
- `automationName` = {string: i.e. uiautomator2 or xcuitest}
- `intentCategory` = {string: i.e. android.intent.category.LEANBACK_LAUNCHER}

# Inline Actions
- ```click(By)```
- ```setText(By, text)```
- ```getText(By)```
- ```isPresent(By)```
- ```getAttribute(By, attribute)```
- ```swipe(SwipeElementDirection, By)```
- etc.

# Inline validations
This is one of the most important features that I want to _*accentuate*_.
- ```validateText```
- ```validateTextNot```
- ```validatePresent```
- ```validateNotPresent```
- ```validateTextPresent```
- ```validateTextNotPresent```

All of these methods are able to be called in-line, and fluently without ever having to break your tests.

# Implicit Waiting
The ```AutomationTest``` class extends on this concept by implenting a sort of ```waitFor``` functionality which ensures that an object appears before interacting with it.  This rids of most ```ElementNotFound``` exceptions that Appium will cough up.

# Pull requests
If you have an idea for the framework, fork it and submit a pull-request!
